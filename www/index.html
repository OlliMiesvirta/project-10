        (this is the introduction overall.) As AI technology advances we are left with the question:
        How will our future AI Overlords match their expectations of supremacy? Will they at least
        sound better than the rest of humanity? To answer this question we have created a database
        for collecting the best of human voices and used an AI algorithm to combine them into a
        voice applications and other AI's can use. In modern age where voices are born and lost
        forever, this is the absolute minimun we can do to preserve our humanity in a vocal form.
